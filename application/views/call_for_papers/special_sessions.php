                                    A special session will generally include at least 4 and a maximum of 6 papers. It is expected that Special Session Chairs engage with their research community to promote their special session and thus support an appropriate number of quality submissions to ensure sufficient coverage of the Special Session topic in the conference to warrant inclusion in the program.

                                    For a special session with less than 6 accepted papers, regular submission papers may be identified according to the organizers to complete the special session. Alternatively, papers associated with the special session may be placed in the regular program. Special session paper submissions are reviewed via the same exact process as submissions to the regular program, and papers are expected to meet the same quality standards.

                                        Special Session proposals should clearly outline the research domain of the special session, highlighting its importance, impact, and relevance to the conference and community at large. As a minimum, proposals should include the special session title, a concise and accessible session description (this will be published on the website for accepted proposals), and a short biography of the organizers. The conference puts a strong emphasis on diversity and we encourage special session proposals from diverse teams.
                                    </p>
